# Cookie-Clicker-Bot

Autoclicker bot that plays Cookie Clicker.

## Usage

Prompts the user for the duration of the game length. Comment the code to let the bot run infinitely.
```python
session_length = float(input("How many minutes to you want to run the Cookie Clicker bot? (Enter an integer ex: 5 ) = "))
```

Cookie Clicker Classic is played since it does not have popups for achievemts or special cookie events which can disrupt the auto clicker. After the auto clicker runs for 5 seconds, it reviews all available upgrades and puchase a single instance of the most expensive one. Have fun!ðŸ˜‹
